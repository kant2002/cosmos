        Can do reg = reg + 4 - define the + overload as a type that can then be 
        reimplicitly converted to a register, or whatever type goes inside Memory[x]</p>
    <p>
        Make it so X# doesnt require the 32 and that it checks register size Memory[EBX, 
        32] = ECX; </p>

        Register.cs - public void Push() { // TODO: This emits Push dword which 
        generates warnings about dword being ignored new Push { DestinationReg = GetId() 
        }; } |<br />
        AL.Push does not work at all.</p>
    <p>
        EAX = Memory[&quot;lable&quot;] does same as addressof.. you have to specify size... size 
        should be infreered and never use teh value of the label</p>
