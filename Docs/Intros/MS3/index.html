    <h3>
        Cosmos?</h3>
    <p>
        Cosmos is short for C# Open Source Managed Operating System. Despite C# being in 
        the name, VB.NET, Fortran, and any .NET language can be used. We chose the C# 
        title because our work is done in C#, and VBOSMOS just does not sound as nice.</p>
    <p>
        Cosmos is not an operating system in the traditional sense, but instead it is 
        &quot;Operating System Kit&quot;, or as I like to say &quot;Operating System Legos&quot;, that allow 
        you to create your own operating system. However having been down this path 
        before, we wanted to make it easy to use and build. Most users can write and 
        boot their own operating system in just a few minutes, and using Visual Studio.</p>
    <p>
        Cosmos lets Visual Studio compile your code to IL and then Cosmos compiles the 
        IL into machine code.</p>
    <h3>
        Dev Kit or User Kit?</h3>
    <p>
        Cosmos comes in two flavors, a user kit and a dev kit. The user kit hides the 
        kernel source away from the user and presents a new project type in file, new. 
        Building a new operating system is as simple as file, new, writing a few lines 
        of code and pressing F5 to build and run it. The user kit is a bit old though, 
        and is really only designed to interest people in obtaining the dev kit.</p>
    <p>
        The dev kit is available as a project on         <a href="http://www.CodePlex.com/Cosmos/">CodePlex</a>, and the Cosmos website 
        is <a href="http://www.GoCosmos.org">www.GoCosmos.org</a>..</p>
    <h3>
        Dev Kit</h3>
    <p>
        To get the dev kit simply sync the sources from the CodePlex project. It might 
        appear daunting at first, 43 projects? A lot of these projects are demos, tests, 
        and playgrounds.</p>
    <p>
        Note that Visual Studio Express cannot handle the solution folders. Because of 
        this Express users should use the Flat solution file, but first you must update 
        the Flat solution file from the main solution using the Flat file updater 
        utility.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="SNAG-0000.jpg" style="width: 203px; height: 178px" /></p>
    <p>
        In the Boot folder, and then the Demo folder you will see a CosmosBoot project. 
        This is the empty shell used in the User Kit for the new project template. This 
        is the minimal Operating System that Cosmos can build. You can copy this file 
        and change it to your needs. Let&#39;s take a quick look.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0001.jpg" style="width: 138px; height: 74px" /></p>
    <p>
        Properties and References are standard parts of any .NET project. Let&#39;s look in 
        Program.cs<p>
        Note on images: CodeProject limits images to 600 pixels in width. I&#39;ve chosen to 
        crop the width to retain readability.<p>
        <img src="SNAG-0002.jpg" style="width: 700px; height: 339px" /></p>
    <p>
        Init is the entry point that will be called after the system is booted. This is 
        where you put your code. Some sample code has been generated already and you can 
        change it. Be sure to leave the first two lines alone, they initialize memory, 
        hardware, etc.</p>
    <p>
        Let&#39;s take a look at something a little more complex though. Here is a demo 
        called Guess. It is a simple application which asks the user to guess a number. 
        As you can see, it is all standard C# code, and aside from the first two lines 
        for booting the code can function unchanged on Windows.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0004.jpg" style="width: 661px; height: 459px" /></p>
    <p>
        NNow let&#39;s run it. Are you expecting some complicated process involving batch 
        files and CD-R&#39;s? If so you will be disappointed. Simply press F5 in Visual 
        Studio to run it. Instead of the project running immediately, you will see a 
        Cosmos Builder Options window.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0007.jpg" style="width: 452px; height: 663px" /></p>
    <p>
        The builder support many environments including physical hardware. Virtual 
        Machines are easier to develop against, and are certainly easier to take 
        screenshots of so I will use VMWare for this article.
    </p>
    <p>
        With these options set, I clicked the Build button (The Enter key also 
        proceeds). Next a build progress window will appear. Cosmos is now compiling the 
        IL to machine code, linking and preparing the boot image.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0011.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" /></p>
    <p>
        When this is done, the window will disappear and VMWare will automatically be 
        launched with an ISO mounted./p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0012.jpg" style="width: 637px; height: 518px" /></p>
    <p>
        Select &quot;Power on this virtual machine&quot; and the Guess demo will boot.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0014.jpg" style="width: 743px; height: 551px" /></p>
    <p>
        TThis is the demo, booted directly to hardware. There is no need for Windows, 
        Linux or any other operating system to run this code. During the boot process 
        you may notice SysLinux. SysLinux however is not a Linux distribution, but 
        instead just a boot loader used to read files from the disk. We use SysLinux 
        instead of Grub because it has support for PXE and other options. SysLinux is 
        only used for initial loading of the Cosmos binaries and as soon as Cosmos is 
        loaded SysLinux is unloaded is not used to run Cosmos code.</p>
    <h3>
        Graphics, Network, File Systems/h3>
    <p>
        Ease of use, or what I like to call &quot;Nail the basics&quot; is a priority for us. 
        However graphics and other things will follow in the future. Currently we are 
        working on a wide range of file systems including FAT and ext2. We are also 
        working on Ethernet support and can already send basic UDP packets, and are 
        working on TCP support as well.</p>
    <h3>
        DDebugging</h3>
    <p>
        Debugging operating systems is typically inconvenient and hinders progress. 
        Because of this, just as we did with making the build and boot process, we 
        strived to make the debugging process easy. The debugger is still a work in 
        progress, but is already quite advanced for an operating system debugger.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0018.jpg" style="width: 268px; height: 85px" /></p>
    <p>
        Adding the Cosmos.Debug namespace gives the code access to communicate directly 
        with the debugger.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0022.jpg" style="width: 294px; height: 161px" /></p>
    <p>
        In the Guess demo I am adding a Debugger.Send, which will write a debug string 
        to the debugger. These can be used to track code execution, but can also be used 
        for watching variables. In this case I will use it to write out the magic 
        number.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0023.jpg" style="width: 347px; height: 125px" /></p>
    <p>
        Notice I have also added a Debugger.Break. This will force the program to 
        execute a breakpoint at that location.</p>
    <p>
        Now let&#39;s run the Guess again. Which demo is booted is selected in Visual Studio 
        simply by selecting it as the startup project for the solution.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0024.jpg" style="width: 253px; height: 100px" /></p>
    <p>
        This time in debugger options Source and User Only is selected. Source tells the 
        debugger to debug C# code, rather than the lower level IL. And User Only tells 
        the debugger not to trace into the Cosmos Kernel or the .NET libraries. This 
        speeds up execution, but also lets me focus on tracing just the demo code.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0025.jpg" style="width: 743px; height: 551px" /></p>
    <p>
        Note that this time it did prompt us for the number yet? This is because it hit 
        the breakpoint. Another window will appear as well, this is the Cosmos Debugger.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0026.jpg" style="width: 720px; height: 379px" /></p>
    <p>
        The message and breakpoint are displayed in the trace log, and the code is 
        selected for the breakpoint. Breakpoints occur on the next statement after the 
        requested break.</p>
    <p>
        Now we can use the Step button (F11, just like Visual Studio) to step through 
        the code. Each step is recorded in the trace log and previous items can be 
        selected to walk backwards through the code. The trace log functions similarly 
        to the call stack window in Visual Studio.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0027.jpg" style="width: 683px; height: 460px" /></p>
    <p>
        Press continue (F5) and the code will run again until a breakpoint is 
        encountered in code, or requested from the debugger. After continue, a new 
        button will appear to that allows a forced instant break. After continue, the 
        code will continue and we will be prompted for the number.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0028.jpg" style="width: 743px; height: 551px" /></p>
    <p>
        We can also turn tracing on and off for specific sections of code using the 
        Cosmos.Debug namespace.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0029.jpg" style="width: 335px; height: 225px" /></p>
    <p>
        This will cause the trace log to be populated with all statement executions 
        between the TraceOn and TraceOff without needing to step through each statement 
        manually.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0030.jpg" style="width: 255px; height: 94px" /></p>
    <p>
        This time Cosmos &amp; User is selected to show more details in the trace log. 
        Normally this option is only needed by developers working on Cosmos kernel 
        source.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="SNAG-0031.jpg" style="width: 764px; height: 559px" /></p>
    <h3>
        Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Cosmos is an open source project as included as part of its name. I hope this 
        article gives an easy to understand introduction. If you are interested in 
        operating system development I hope you will try Cosmos!</p>
