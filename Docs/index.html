  <h3>Docs</h3>
  <p>
    This is the main &quot;working&quot; docs area. Many of the docs may be out of date, but we try to update them as we can.</p>
  <h3>Navigation</h3>
  <p>
    The visual studio html editor is a bit sucky, espeically in later versions. So the docs are not cross linked, instead simply browse the diretories for topics.</p>
