    <h3>
        Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        The debugger is a monumental piece of work and one of the key enabling elements 
        of making Cosmos unique. We have put an immense amount of work into the debugger 
        and will continue to do so even though it takes a lot of time and detracts from 
        resources that could be used to develop Cosmos kernel code. We do this because 
        we believe that every hour put into the debugger will be returned in many times 
        as many hours saved in kernel development. Some users have criticized this 
        approach, but we stand firm in this belief and believe that Cosmos success rests 
        heavily on the debugger and tight Visual Studio integration.</p>
    <h3>
        Obstacles</h3>
    <p>
        The Visual Studio debugger is only lightly documented (lightly might be a kind 
        adjective). There are few if any samples and much of our progress is the result 
        of sheer determination and experimentation.</p>
