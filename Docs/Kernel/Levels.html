        The security model of&nbsp; Cosmos will evolve and mature as Cosmos does, however the base model is presented here.</p>
    <h3>
        Goals</h3>
    <p>
        Most operating systems today use hardware to enforce security between the kernel, user code, etc. This creates a lot of overhead at runtime and decreases performance. Intel CPUs have built this into the hardware, but adds a fair bit of circuitry and complexity. Despite being in hardware, it still incurs a measureable performance penalty. Since Cosmos can control execution and rebuild its compiler and recompile all code at any time, Cosmos can be much more flexible and most restrictions can be enforced at compile or installation time rather than the need to perform such CPU checks in live CPU code. This creates huge performance gains but also allows a lot more flexibility.</p>
    <h3>
        Future</h3>
    <p>
        Currently only the structure exists, no checking occurs but in the future will occur via attributes and other methods. Future checks to include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Restriction of core level exclusive abilities at the assembly level by attribute.</li>
      <li>Restriction of references list to higher levels only. ie HAL can reference Core but not vice versa. Also via attribute. That is an assembly level attribute to mark which level an assembly is.</li>
      <li>Restrict access to BCL and other assemblies. ie Core should never need XML or other higher level services. Make a defined list of what is allowed and verify against it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For now we must be vigilant to watch these restrictions manually.</p>
    <h3>
        Levels</h3>
    <p>
        Many operating systems refer to their security &quot;areas&quot; as rings. ie Kernel ring, etc. Rings are harder to draw in text and make diagramming a bit harder, so for now we will refer to our &quot;areas&quot; as levels.</p>
    <p>
        Cosmos is split into the following levels:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>0 Core</li>
      <li>1 Hardware</li>
      <li>2 System</li>
      <li>3 User</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each level can only communicate with adjacent levels. That is User can only talk to System, but not Core.</p>
    <h3>0 Core Level</h3>
    <p>
      Core level has special permissions which basically let it do anyting it wants. core code should be very limited with most kernel code existing in the System level. Core code should be kept to a minimum with code not requiring special permissions should be moved or split into the system level.</p>
    <p>
      Special abilities that core has exclusively:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Assembly plugs</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Core 0 exists to provide access to direct hardware. C# code should mostly exist in level 1 instead, with level 0 being intended for code that can exist only in level 0 such as assembly code.</p>
    <p>
      Examples:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Plugs that must be implemented in assembly</li>
      <li>Memory management</li>
      <li>Direct generic IO access to map to C# functions</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>1 HAL (Hardware) Level</h3>
    <p>
      From the HAL (hardware abstraction level) level up, none of the special permissions available in core level are available. If such code is needed, it must be split between system and core.</p>
    <p>
      HAL in some senses might be thought of as a sub level of level 0, but exists to help separate assembly and other such code. HAL must not simply proxy access to code. For example, level 0 will expose functions to directly access IO ports, but level 2 should never be able to perform such raw access. HAL must wrap and encapselate such access. For example, instead of proxying access to a specific port drivers exists in HAL to expose access to a specific device such as an IDE controller.</p>
    <p>
      Examples:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Hardware specific drivers - any code that needs to talk to hardware via core.0.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>2 System Level</h3>
    <p>System level contains all such code that is not wrapping hardware directly but instead adding higher level functionality. ie file systems, etc. The distinction between level 1 and 2 is a manual one and no technical restrictions currently exist aside from the restriction of higher level reference only.</p>
    <p>System.2 should not contain system applications, but instead system functionality.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>File systems</li>
      <li>BCL plugs</li>
      <li>Network stacks</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>3 User Level</h3>
    <p>
      No Cosmos.3.User project exists because level 3 is user code. ie applications. When a user creates a new application (or currently monolithic project) the code is level 3.</p>
    <p>
      Examples:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>User applications</li>
      <li>System applications</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Namespace</h3>
    <p>
      Projects have been named with the level number in them to allow sorting (ie Cosmos.0.Core) in VS, but the output libraries and namespaces do not include such numbers (ie Cosmos.Core.dll, Cosmos.Core). This produces cleaner code, but also easily allows future levels to be inserted or changed.</p>
    <h1>
        Older Ring Docs</h1>
    <p>
        Surely our security model will evolve as Cosmos evolves. However we need 
        something simple, efficient, and with minimal impact to the users. I feel this 
        is something most operating systems today fail greatly at.</p>
    <p>
        A new assembly level attribute will be created for processing by IL2CPU. If the 
        attribute is not present User Ring is the default.</p>
    <p>
        Rings from highest to lowest:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User<ul>
            <li>System<ul>
                <li>Hardware<ul>
                    <li>Core</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Ring Control</h3>
    <p>
        Rings can only access assemblies in the same ring, or the next lower ring.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Core &lt;-- Hardware &lt;-- System &lt;-- User</p>
    <p>
        For example, System can consume classes in Hardware but not Kernel.</p>
    <h3>
        Core Ring</h3>
    <p>
        In the core ring, &quot;anything goes&quot;. This also means that code which does not 
        require such privileges should not exist in the core ring. The core ring should 
        be restricted to code which truly needs such unfettered access.
    </p>
    <p>
        Priviliges that exist only in the core ring:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use of pointers and direct access to memory</li>
        <li>Access to x86 IO ports.</li>
        <li>Explicit assembly language code</li>
        <li>Unsafe code</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The core ring includes functionality such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Threading</li>
        <li>Memory management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Assemblies which are part of the core are restricted.</p>
    <p>
        The core ring exposes objects which allow the hardware ring to access memory 
        indirectly, and in a controlled restricted fashion. For example to allow a 
        driver to acccess video RAM, a memory object can be created by the core ring 
        which allows access to only the specific block of memory needed by the video 
        driver.</p>
    <h3>
        Hardware Ring</h3>
    <p>
        The hardware ring contains drivers and code for accessing hardware via more 
        generic objects exposed by the kernel ring.</p>
    <p>
        The hardware ring includes functionality such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IDE</li>
        <li>SATA</li>
        <li>Ethernet</li>
        <li>USB Controller</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The hardware ring may be further split into two levels at a later date. For 
        example, a driver may exist for the USB Controller and it would require access 
        to the core ring. But drivers implementing USB devices do not need to talk to 
        hardware directly, but instead talk to the USB Controller driver.</p>
    <h3>
        System Ring</h3>
    <p>
        The system ring contains code which builds functionality on top of hardware or 
        other system assemblies.</p>
    <p>
        The system ring includes functionality such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>File systems</li>
        <li>TCP/IP</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        User Ring</h3>
    <p>
        The user ring is compromised of all user code including applications and 
        services.</p>
