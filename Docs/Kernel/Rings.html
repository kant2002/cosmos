        Surely our security model will evolve as Cosmos evolves. However we need 
        something simple, efficient, and with minimal impact to the users. I feel this 
        is something most operating systems today fail greatly at.</p>
    <p>
        Cosmos will be divided into rings. In some senses they are similar to 
        traditional operating system rings however they are not enforced by hardware and 
        thus do not have the runtime overhead. Instead they are enforced by the compiler 
        and later by the installation system which will verify assemblies are part of 
        installation.</p>
    <p>
        A new assembly level attribute will be created for processing by IL2CPU. If the 
        attribute is not present User Ring is the default.</p>
    <p>
        From lowest to highest:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kernel<ul>
            <li>Hardware<ul>
                <li>System<ul>
                    <li>User</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Ring Control</h3>
    <p>
        Rings can only access assemblies in the same ring, or the next lower ring.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">
        Kernel &lt;-- Hardware &lt;-- System &lt;-- User</p>
    <p>
        For example, System can consume classes in Hardware but not Kernel.</p>
    <h3>
        Kernel Ring</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <h3>
        Hardware Ring</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <h3>
        System Ring</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <h3>
        User Ring</h3>
    <p>
        The user ring is compromised of all user code including applications and 
        services.</p>

    <h3>
        Kernel Ring</h3>
    <p>
        In the Kernel Ring, all things are permitted including unsafe code. Assemblies 
        that can be marked as Kernel Ring are restricted. A protected list of assemblies 
        is maintained and enforced my IL2CPU and the installation system.</p>
    <p>
        Kernel Ring includes memory management, process and thread control, etc. Things 
        common to all PCs.</p>
    <p>
        Permitted: Anything</p>
    <p>
        Restrictions: Assembly must be approved by policy to be part of Kernel.</p>
    <h3>
        Hardware Ring</h3>
    <p>
        Hardware Ring contains drivers for hardware. Hardware Ring cannot contain unsafe 
        code but can access the managed memory object (see separate annotation) to 
        ensure proper alignment of structures etc. Kernel Ring can assign specific PCI, 
        USB and other devices to drivers and communicate with such devices through the 
        Kernel Ring and managed memory objects, but cannot access pointers directly.</p>
    <h3>
        System Ring</h3>
    <p>
        The System Ring includes file systems, network stacks, etc. Unsafe code is not 
        permitted.<br />
