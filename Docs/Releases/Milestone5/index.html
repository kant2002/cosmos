    <h3>
        Special Notes</h3>
    <p>
        MS5 does not work with Visual Studio Express Edition. This is because the 
        Express Editions do not allow Visual Studio extensibility. We have plans in the 
        near future to provide some basic support to Express users.</p>
    <h3>
        New Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Integrated Debugger</li>
        <li>Custom Project type</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Known Issues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Stepping will cause a crash of the guest.</li>
        <li>Only QEMU and VMWare Workstation and Player are supported. Others will be 
            resupported soon, but can be used manually by mounting the ISO. ISO however isnt 
            supported in this release, so you need to run the VMWare version and pluck the 
            ISO from the output directory</li>
    </ul>
