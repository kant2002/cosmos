    <h3>
        Cosmos.Assembler</h3>
    <p>
        Base platform independent project for emitting machine langauge. 
        Currenly only x86 uses this but later ARM etc.</p>
    <h3>
        Cosmos.Assembler.XSharp</h3>
    <p>
        Higher level x86 assembler. Its paralell to Cosmos.Assembler.x86 as it is meant 
        to be an alternative language although it does rely on and use 
        Cosmos.Assembler.x86.</p>
    <h3>
        Cosmos.Assembler.x86</h3>
    <p>
        Holds ops for raw assembly. Currently does output to NASM too, but in future the 
        binary and NASM (and X# for output debugging) should be in separate assemblies 
        so the generation / output is seperated from the storage/assembly used by the 
        compiler. Cant be descendant classes because we create new objects directly in 
        code.. Maybe Cosmos.AsmGen.x86.NASM, Binary, etc... and use arrays of typeofs?</p>
