            Cosmos.Debug contains common classes and enums used by the client debugger in 
            Cosmos.Build.Windows and also by Cosmos.Kernel itself. Because of this extreme 
            care must be take of which assemblies are linked and this assembly should not 
            link in any other Cosmos assemblies.</p>
