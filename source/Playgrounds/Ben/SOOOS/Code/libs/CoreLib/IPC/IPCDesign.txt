See the design document but since we are in uncharted waters with managed IPC 
we will try several and optomize them, this means the initial implimentation may be a bit heavy especially in the use of some virtual calls .
I have tried to mimize these as well as dependence between IPC and the Scheduler/ Memory ( though obviously this requires more indirections which conteaditcs the first statement)  
this allows many different options eg Aysnc queued with efficient cache vs fast ping as the service desires and all clients will be compatible which may outweigh the cost.

Anyway while its certain we will need to improve and maybe hand code ( assembly) IPC we wont prematurely optomize and check a number of algorithms first.
