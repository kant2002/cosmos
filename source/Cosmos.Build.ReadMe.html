    <h3>
        Cosmos.Build.Common</h3>
    <p>
        This contains constants, enums etc that are shared by the build tools. If any 
        executable code exists, it should be generic.</p>
    <h3>
        Cosmos.Build.DevKit</h3>
    <p>
        Project for installing dev kit.</p>
    <h3>
        Cosmos.Build.Install</h3>
    <p>
        Class library that implements batch / install functions.</p>
    <h3>
        Cosmos.Build.InstallCleaner</h3>
    <p>
        Dont think this is used any more. Appears to be from VS 2008. Should delete or 
        update if needed.</p>
    <h3>
        Cosmos.Build.StandAlone</h3>
	
	    <p>
            This program exists for debugging the MSBuild task.</p>
        <p>
            It currently does not work. We need to seperate out the MSBuild IL2CPU task into 
            a seperate class, then use it from here and from the current MSBuild task.</p>
