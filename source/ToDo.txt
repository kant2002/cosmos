Hit a BP, then press stop in VS. Crash.. missing VIX API? If so warn instead?

Project templates - Target=4.5, Tools=12.0
I had to edit Kudzu.Breakpoints.Cosmos to make these changes:
Changed tools version from 4.5 to 12.0. Did this while debugging other things.. not sure if its needed but seems that it should match the kernel which had 12.0?
<Project ToolsVersion="12.0" DefaultTargets="Build" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
Added this:
    <TargetFrameworkVersion>v4.5</TargetFrameworkVersion>
Until I did this, VS would warn me that kernel and others were a higher .NET target than the project.
Do we need to open a todo item on these and fix something in our templates or other?
