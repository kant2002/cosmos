Message: Location
-UInt32 - Cross referenced into debug file which then can cross reference to cs file, 
and byte position. Not line as C# allows more than one statement per line. How to map
our IL input into C# file? Can we parse the .pdb files? Also cross referenced into IL and asm file

Message: Variable
-Set when variable value changes

Message: Breakpoint
-Breakpoint occurred - also allow breakpoints to be set. Need to leave noops in place that can be swapped

UI's
-New dialog after build dialog
-Debug output Window in VS
-Later on, all in VS

Questions
-How easy to feed into VS? - See note on express editions...
-Simulate VS remote debug process?
-Express editions do not allow loading of extensions - so may need to focus on our own
UI then later we can have optional alternate plugins for non express as well.
-Use reflector style functionaly to reverse to C# if we have to? Can we link to reflector itself?
