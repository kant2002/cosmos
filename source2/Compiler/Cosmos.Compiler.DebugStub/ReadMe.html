            Cosmos.Compiler.DebugStub</h3>
        <p>
            I debated for a while if this was Kernel or Compiler. However the DebugStub must 
            remain isolated in nature, which is also why we rely on polling the serial 
            rather than IRQs. So in the end I decided since its debugging only and not part 
            of Cosmos itself, it belongs in Compiler.</p>
