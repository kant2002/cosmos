            Cosmos.Debug contains common classes and enums that runs on both Windows and 
            Cosmos. The Debugger uses it to receive messages from the debugstub in Cosmos, 
            and Cosmos uses it to compile into the debug stub.</p>
        <p>
            Because of this extreme care must be take of which assemblies are linked and 
            this assembly should not link in any other Cosmos assemblies.</p>
