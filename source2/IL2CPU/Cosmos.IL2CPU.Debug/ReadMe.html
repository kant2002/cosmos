            Cosmos.Debug contains common classes and enums that runs on both Windows and 
            Cosmos. The Debugger uses it to receive messages from the debugstub in Cosmos, 
            and Cosmos uses it to compile into the debug stub.</p>
      <p>
            This unit should only contain constants and basic structures. No executable code 
            should exist in this assembly.</p>
      <p>
            References - The references should be absolutely minimal.....</p>
        <p>
            Because of this extreme care must be take of which assemblies are linked and 
            this assembly should not link in any other Cosmos assemblies.</p>
      <p>
            Cosmos.Compiler.Debug is a bit of misnomer, it should be renamed possibly in the 
            future (Constants? Common?). It is used by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DebugStub (running in Cosmos)</li>
        <li>Compiler (To communicate commands to the DebugStub over serial port)</li>
        <li>Cosmos.VS.Debug</li>
        <li>Cosmos.VS.Windows</li>
      </ul>
