      Building a VS Tool Window package is easy. Deploying it apparently is not, and 
      because we deploy even at dev time with a setup.exe, we need to deploy it. VS 
      Tool Window packages use WPF UserControls though, so for now we use this 
      separate standalone EXE which uses WPF UserControls.</p>
