<h3>
    To Do</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Urgent: Debugger interferes with normal apps. This explains the weirdness I&#39;m 
        seeing when trying to debug my GDB debugger, and it even interferes with running 
        of it under VS, even when no breakpoints etc are set. This is urgent to fix!</li>
    <li>Build: ISOs etc get rebuilt even when Im running a non Cosmos project (such as 
        GDB)</li>
    <li>Breakpoints before run</li>
    <li>Multiple breakpoints</li>
    <li>Icon for .cosmos, and associate with Visual Studio</li>
    <li>Launch GDB client</li>
    <li>serial speed </li>

        installing, it tries to debug normal apps, which of course fails. &gt; + when 
        having the project disabled in the solution configuration, you &gt; can still try 
        to run it (which fails, it cant find the .cmap file). To &gt; try this, seleect the 
        Bootstrap configuration, and try to run breakpoints. &gt; &gt; + overall stability </li>
