            Comos.Debug.HostProcess</h3>
        <p>
            VS debugger requires a process that starts paused, and is then later started. To 
            do this and to unify the process that is used, we use a proxy process which then 
            controls the actual execution environment (VMWare, QEMU, etc).</p>
